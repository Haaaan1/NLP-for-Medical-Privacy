    <h2>About This Tool</h2>
    <p>This medical data anonymization platform leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to protect sensitive information in unstructured clinical texts, supporting both English and German languages.</p>
    <p>This tool is designed for the thesis work "Developing a Natural Language Processing Tool for Enhanced Privacy Protection in Medical Data " done at Communication Systems Group, University of Zurich, supervised by Mr. Weijie Niu, Dr. Alberto Huertas Celdran and Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller.</p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advanced Entity Recognition</strong>: Utilizes a high-precision Medical-NER model (85%+ accuracy for English, 75%+ for German) to identify sensitive patient information</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible De-identification</strong>: Offers multiple protection strategies:
            <ul>
                <li>Deletion (complete redaction)</li>
                <li>Pseudonymization (label-based replacement)</li>
                <li>Generalization (for Age/Date with adjustable precision levels)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Risk Assessment</strong>: Computes weighted risk scores before and after processing to demonstrate effectiveness</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Input Formats</strong>: Accepts both plain text and CSV file uploads</li>
    </ul>
